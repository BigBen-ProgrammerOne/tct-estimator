# Truck Cycle Time Estimator

The Truck Cycle Time Estimator App, or TCT Estimator App for short, will primarily be used to compute estimations or predictions on the duration of each leg of the truck cycle time.

The results will primarily be timestamps of the start and end times of each leg, as well as the duration per leg of the trip.

Instructions on how to use the app are provided in the User Manual.
